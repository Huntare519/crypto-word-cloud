# crypto-word-cloud

Crypto Word Cloud seeks to scrape popular web3 job sites to index the current jobs on the market. In it's current iteration, it only scrapes _lever_ and _greenhouse_ job boards. Once collected, we can use the resulting job titles to make a word cloud of jobs available in the space! We believe this is a powerful way to visually show that web3 companies are not only hiring shadowy-super-coders and weird ceos, instead almost every job title is needed.

In the future, we may expand this project to create an internal job scraper for the Badger Blockchain club. More forthcoming.
